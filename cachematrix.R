## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may
## be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than
## compute it repeatedly. The following pair of functions will
## cache the inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x<<-y
    i<<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i<<- inverse
  getinverse <- function()i
  list(set=set, get=get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special
## "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has 
## already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data,...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
